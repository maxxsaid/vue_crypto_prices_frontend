## Project Summary

- A cryptocurrency price tracker website. This app monitors the current value of different digital currencies and tokens. The goal for this website is to make it easy for the user to sign in and store their favorite digital currencies. This website uses CoinAPI.io/ to get the most accurate currency data. Simply sign up and log in to start using this website.

## User Stories

- User can sign up/log in
- User gets to add a new coin to their list by adding the currency code (ex. BTC, ETH)
- If the user isnt sure about the codes, they simply get to press on the "i" and a modal with a list of updated codes pops up with every coins logo.
- If the user doesnt like how the code looks after adding a coin, they can simple press on update and change the name.
- If the user decides to remove the coin, they can press delete.
